## Speedgame
#### school project inspired by real-life game, where user presses the button in the order they light up.
#### Game is in bug-mode at the moment. Game starts right after the page load, and game ends automatically after 3 seconds with modal message 'game ended, your score was null'

### What i learned from this mini-project was that everything is based on indexes in JavaScript.
